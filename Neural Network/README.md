# Folder Descriptions

## Replay_model

- **Last Commit Message:** Update
- **Last Commit Date:** Now

This folder contains the replay model files used for training and evaluation purposes. The replay model implements a technique for training models using past experiences stored in a replay buffer, enhancing learning efficiency and stability in reinforcement learning scenarios.

## Scripts

- **Last Commit Message:** Update README.md
- **Last Commit Date:** 3 minutes ago

The `Scripts` folder contains various scripts and utility files used in the project. These scripts may include data preprocessing scripts, model training scripts, evaluation scripts, and other supporting utilities essential for the project's development and execution.

## Trained_ANN_Models

This folder houses the trained artificial neural network (ANN) models generated during the project's development. ANN models are trained machine learning models that mimic the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. These models are trained on labeled datasets to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.
