# Folder Descriptions

## Combined_Dataset


The [Combined_Dataset](https://github.com/sankalp-s/MSC_Thesis/tree/main/Player_Inputs/Dataset/Combined_Dataset) folder contains combined datasets comprising sessions from both YoshiIsland1 and YoshiIsland2. Each session captures gameplay data for different levels of the Super Mario World game environment.

## YoshiIsland1

The [YoshiIsland1](https://github.com/sankalp-s/MSC_Thesis/tree/main/Player_Inputs/Dataset/YoshiIsland1) folder stores datasets specifically related to gameplay sessions in level 1 of the Super Mario World environment. These datasets contain recorded gameplay data, including features extracted from RAM arrays and corresponding action labels.

## YoshiIsland2

The [YoshiIsland2](https://github.com/sankalp-s/MSC_Thesis/tree/main/Player_Inputs/Dataset/YoshiIsland2) folder contains datasets corresponding to gameplay sessions in level 2 of the Super Mario World environment. Similar to YoshiIsland1, these datasets encompass gameplay data collected during sessions in level 2, comprising features extracted from RAM arrays and associated action labels.

The separation of datasets into `YoshiIsland1` and `YoshiIsland2` folders allows for organized storage and easy access to gameplay data specific to different levels within the Super Mario World game environment.
