# PPO & A2C Folders

The [PPO](https://github.com/sankalp-s/MSC_Thesis/tree/main/RL/PPO) & [A2C](https://github.com/sankalp-s/MSC_Thesis/tree/main/RL/A2C) folders contain scripts and resources related to training and replaying reinforcement learning (RL) agents using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithms in the Super Mario World environment. These folders include:

- **Training Scripts**: Scripts for training RL agents using the PPO and A2C algorithms. These scripts configure the environment, set up logging, preprocess observations, define the learning rate schedule, train the RL model, and save the trained model.

- **Replay Scripts**: Scripts for replaying RL agents trained with the PPO and A2C algorithms. These scripts load pre-trained models, set up the environment, preprocess observations, and allow the agent to interact with the environment based on the learned policy.

The PPO & A2C folders serve as comprehensive resources for implementing and experimenting with PPO and A2C-based RL algorithms in the Super Mario World environment, providing both training and replaying functionalities for reinforcement learning tasks.
